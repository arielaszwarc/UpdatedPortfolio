                  <p> <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong></p>
                  <p>I began having an interest In Web Development early on in 2020. Over the course of that year I took many JavaScript course and mini bootcamps. 
                    What i really took a liking to was how incredible it was to work as a team and solve problems as well as helping in the creation of something new. 
                    I hope that with the help of this Rutgers Bootcamp I am able to take my skills to the next level and improve upon what I already know.</p>
